# io-speedtest
This script will use the official Speedtest.net CLI https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli
It runs the tool and grabs the JSON output

It then uploads this data to an Adafruit IO Dashboard.

## Using this tool

You will need to signup for an IO account (https://accounts.adafruit.com/users/sign_up)

Once you have an account you will need to create a file "apikey.py" and put in the correct details

## Setting up your system
If you run "install.sh" it will install the required components and python requirements.
